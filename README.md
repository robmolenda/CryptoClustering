# CryptoClustering
In this challenge we use unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7 day price changes. Please clone the repository and run in VS code.

Note: I had difficulty in rendering the scatter plots for some reason. I checked with classmates and looked for resources online but was unable to render the scatter plots using my code.
